Data comes from SuperDataScience Support. These datasets were orginally used in their A-to-Z course for Data science as well as the Advance R course. These data were used to introduce one to topics in R. Since learning the Tidyverse, I have returned to these datasets and reworked them using dplyer and other packages in the tidyverse. This has resulted in visually appealing and simpler code.
